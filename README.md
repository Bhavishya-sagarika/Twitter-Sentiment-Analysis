# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project analyzes tweets to determine public sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) toward a topic, product, or event. Using the Twitter API, tweets are collected in real time or from historical data, then preprocessed through cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal.
